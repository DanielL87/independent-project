      <h1>What is Duel Links?</h1>
        <p>Duel links is an official mobile app where countles players from around the world can get together
        and play the popular card game Yu-Gi-Oh! from the comfort of their phones or desktop.Released by Konami in the spring of
        2016, it has quickly garnered hundreds of thousands of regular players. Konami even hosts officials tournaments with
        prizes ranging from in game rewards to cash prizes. The gme is abridged and has several key differences from the IRL card game.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Life points start at <em><strong>4000</strong></em> per player instead of <em><strong>8000</strong></em></li>
            <li>Starting hands consist of 4 cards instead of the normal 5</li>
            <li>There are only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the extra deck is limited to 5 cards</li>
            <li>Main Deck limits are from 20-30 cards</li>
            <li>There is no Main Phase 2!</li>
            <li>Introduces character specific skills ranging from starting the game with a field spell active to a free mulligan and much more!</li>
          </ul>

        <p>The game feels simplified but the changes are not unwelcome. This is an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. Additionally
        no-one can deny the quality of the game, bugs are rare and immediately addressed. In game events are so plentiful, the single player mode rarely feels repetitive, and the
        online aspect feels polished and rarely lags. The amount of effort put into ensuring the game runs smoothly is obvious.</p>

      <h2>How Duel Links has changed dramatically over the years(for the worse)</h1>
        <p>I have been playing the game of Yu-Gi-Oh on and off for several years now, and Duel links Specifically for 2.
        As with anything, there are bound to be problems, and its unrealistic to satisfy everyone. First and foremost, Konami is a company looking to
        make a profit. I sicerely question some of the business decisions they make concerning this game though. Konami is notorious for choosing profit ovee
        customers, and I feel this endangers the future of the game i have come to enjoy so much.</p>

        <h3>The Pitfalls of Gems and Play to win tactics</h3>
          <p>The primary incentive of Duel Links is to collect cards in order to improve your deck. One can do this
           by spending in game currency known as Gems at the card shop, which typically cost 50 gems for a 3 card pack. Cards are randomly generated so there
           there is never any guarantee with what is received. Cards are also won by PVE duels and an in game card trader that allows you to swap out card you don't need for
           new ones. The problem? Konami has noticibly decreased the gems given out as rewards with each update. Gems are a scarce comoodity as it is, and considering packs can
           cost around 1.99 a pack, they are the only method some players can afford new cards. They have also stopped releasing powerful cards through the card trader, with each new
           Card Box released, its becoming harder and harder for some players to keep up with the power creep. The end result is having to spend a large amount of money
           just to remain relevant</p>

        <h3>Is the Meta becoming Toxic?</h3>
          <p>Apart from the questionable business practices itself, some players feel the competitive meta-game (Meta) has become stagnant.
          some deck archetypes have clearly pulled far ahead of the competition, and you'll find yourself dueling the same deck over and over again in PvP
          Matches. This gets boring after some time, but worse than that, it stifles variety and diversity. There is little incentive to use a rougue deck
          when consecutive wins can earn you great rewards</p>

        <h3>Is Konami Even Listening?</h3>
          <p>The most glaring problem I see is Konami's seemingly unwillingness to address these concerns. In fact, it seems they're stepping on the gas pedal
          in the completely opposite direction. Gems only become scarcer with every passing update. The number of packs in a box has increased without increasing the number of rare cards,
          thus making it harder to get what you want without spending precious gems, and the card trader hasn't had a meta relevant card since "That Grass looks Greener" back in March.
          The biggest Irony is that they hold monthly Surveys asking for public opinions, and they have addressed some concerns, so they know about all this, yet for some reason they
          choose to turn a blind eye.</p>

      <h2>How can Konami truly address these issues in a satifactory way?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stop the obvious Nerfs of Gem outputs and release Meta relevant Cards through the Card Trader</li>
          <li>Balance the game with bi-monthly updates to the Forbidden and Limited List and Character Skills</li>
          <li>Surveys and user Forums exist, use them!</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Final Word</h2>
        <p>As a consumer I like to invest my money in something long term. Unless Konami addresses some of the problems I have outlined above, I cannot in good faith
        continue spending more money on a game whose future seems unceirtain. Don't get me wrong, I understand that money is important, but like with any good competitive deck, balance is important.</p>
